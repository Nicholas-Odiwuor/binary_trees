# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Description
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to binary trees in C programming language. The tasks involve implementing various functions to work with binary trees such as creating, traversing, inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style, checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- Allowed to use the standard library
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file `binary_trees.h`
- All header files should be include guarded

## Data Structures
The project uses the following data structures for binary trees:
- Basic Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Max Binary Heap

## Print Function
A print function is provided for visualization purposes. It is not required to include it in your repository.

## Files
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary data structures.
- `0-binary_tree_node.c`: Function to create a new binary tree node.
- Other files for various functions as per the tasks.

## How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Compile the C files using the provided flags.
- Include `binary_trees.h` header file in your source files where necessary.
- Implement your functions according to the task requirements.

## Example Usage (main.c)
```c
#include "binary_trees.h"

int main(void)
{
    /* Your test code here */
    return (0);
}
